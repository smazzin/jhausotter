## Hello I'm Josh, an experienced web designer / developer.

My passion is for anything web related. I specialize in creating websites that are user-friendly and built according to best-practice web standards. **If you are a business seeking a web presence, you can get in touch with me [here](/contact)**.

In my spare time I do freelance web design and web development. I enjoy snowboarding, coffee, and love the outdoors.

This site was built with Hugo, a static site generator. Hugo is fast and was simple to learn. Curious on [how I configured this site with nginx + ngx_pagespeed](here) to acheive optimal performance?
