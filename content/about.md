Hello I'm Josh, an experienced web designer / developer. My passion is for anything web related. In my spare time I do freelance web design and web development. I enjoy snowboarding, coffee, and love the outdoors.

I specialize in creating websites that are user-friendly and built according to best-practice web standards. If you are a business seeking a web presence, you can get in touch with me [here](contact).
